# 3 Triple Connectivity Mode Architecture


#### 1 Standard Mode (Hub as HID/MIDI/Audio device to host)

      - USB HID Device Implementation (Keyboard, mouse, generic HID)
      - USB MIDI Device Implementation (Standard MIDI controller)
      - USB Audio Device Implementation (Audio interface, control surface)
      - Bluetooth HID/MIDI Implementation (Wireless standard devices)
      - No Host Software Required (Plug-and-play compatibility)

#### 2 Drimit Link Mode (Drimit Link software required on host device)

      - Enhanced Protocol Communication (Full DL-OS feature access)
      - Grid State Synchronization (Real-time system management)
      - Advanced Features (Telemetry, debug, OTA updates)
      - Multi-Platform Host Software (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android)
      - Plugin Architecture (DAW, NLE, streaming software integration)

#### 3 Cloud-Direct Mode (Hub connects directly to cloud via Wi-Fi/Ethernet)

      - No Host Device Required (Autonomous cloud operation)
      - Multi-Protocol Cloud Stack (HTTPS REST, WebSocket, SSE)
      - Real-Time Grid State Synchronization (Cloud-based management)
      - Remote Configuration and Monitoring (Web-based dashboard)
      - Fleet Management Capabilities (Multi-hub coordination)

#### 4 Mode Selection and Compatibility Matrix

      - Automatic Mode Detection and Switching
      - Feature Availability by Mode (Compatibility matrix)
      - Performance Characteristics per Mode (Latency, throughput)
      - Fallback and Recovery Mechanisms
