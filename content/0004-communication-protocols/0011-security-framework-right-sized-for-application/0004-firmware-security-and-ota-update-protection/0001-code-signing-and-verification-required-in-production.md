# 1 Code Signing and Verification (Required in Production)


#### 1 Digital Signature Algorithms (RSA-2048/ECDSA-P256)

      - Key Generation Requirements and Entropy Sources
      - Signature Format and ASN.1 Encoding Standards
      - Hash Algorithm Requirements (SHA-256 minimum)
      - Cryptographic Library Integration Guidelines

> **Schema Required: ASN.1 signature format definitions**


> **Pseudocode Required: Signature verification and chain validation algorithms**


> **Test Vectors Required: Sample signatures and validation test cases**


#### 2 Certificate Chain Validation

      - Root Certificate Authority (CA) Trust Store Management
      - Intermediate Certificate Validation Procedures
      - Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Handling
      - Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Support

> **Certificate Schema Required: X.509 certificate format and extensions**


#### 3 Development vs Production Signing Keys

      - Development Key Generation and Distribution
      - Production Key Escrow and Recovery Procedures
      - Key Rotation and Migration Strategies
      - Hardware Security Module (HSM) Integration

> **Key Management Schema Required: Key lifecycle and storage formats**
