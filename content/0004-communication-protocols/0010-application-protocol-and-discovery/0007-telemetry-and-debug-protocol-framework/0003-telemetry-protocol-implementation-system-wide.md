# 3 Telemetry Protocol Implementation (System-Wide)


#### 1 Performance Metrics Collection and Reporting

      - End-to-End Latency Measurement (Event generation to host processing)
      - Message Throughput Statistics (Events/second per module and system-wide)
      - Communication Error Rates (CRC errors, timeouts, retransmissions)
      - Bus Utilization Monitoring (Bandwidth usage, arbitration delays)
      - Memory Usage Tracking (RAM, flash, buffer utilization)
      - CPU Load Analysis (Task execution time, interrupt latency)

#### 2 System Health Monitoring and Environmental Sensors

      - Temperature Monitoring (MCU die temp, ambient sensors)
      - Power Quality Metrics (Voltage levels, current consumption, ripple)
      - Connection Quality Assessment (Contact resistance, signal integrity)
      - Mechanical Wear Indicators (Connection cycles, force measurements)
      - Environmental Conditions (Humidity, vibration, ambient light)

#### 3 Usage Analytics and Behavioral Pattern Tracking

      - User Interaction Patterns (Button press frequency, control usage)
      - Module Configuration Changes (Layout modifications, preference updates)
      - Performance Optimization Hints (Hotkeys, workflow patterns)
      - Error Recovery Statistics (Fault frequency, recovery success rates)
      - Feature Utilization Analysis (Most/least used functions)

#### 4 Telemetry Data Aggregation and Batching Strategies

      - Time-Based Batching (1-second, 1-minute, 1-hour intervals)
      - Event-Count-Based Batching (100, 1000 event thresholds)
      - Priority-Based Immediate Reporting (Critical alerts, errors)
      - Adaptive Sampling Rates (High-frequency during issues, low during normal)
      - Local Storage and Buffering (Offline operation support)

#### 5 Cloud Telemetry Integration and Privacy Controls

      - Anonymous Usage Statistics (Opt-in aggregate data sharing)
      - Personal Data Protection (GDPR compliance, data minimization)
      - Cloud-Based Analytics Dashboard (Fleet management, trend analysis)
      - Remote Diagnostics and Support (Authorized technician access)
      - Data Retention Policies (Local vs cloud storage duration)

> **Data Schema Required: Telemetry metrics data structures and collection formats**


> **Configuration Table Required: Debug message types and verbosity levels**


> **Privacy Framework Required: Data collection consent and anonymization procedures**
