# 2 Debounce and False Connection Prevention (20ms minimum stabilization)


#### 1 Mechanical Bounce Detection Algorithm

      - Multi-Stage Debounce Implementation (Hardware + Software)
      - Contact Resistance Threshold Monitoring (>1MΩ open, <100mΩ closed)
      - Signal Edge Rate Analysis (Bounce vs intentional connection)
      - Temperature Compensation for Contact Resistance

#### 2 Signal Stabilization Validation Criteria

      - Minimum Stable Period: 20ms continuous contact
      - Maximum Acceptable Resistance Variation: ±10mΩ
      - Power Rail Stability Requirements: ±2% voltage tolerance
      - Communication Link Establishment: CAN bus idle detection

#### 3 False Positive Rejection Mechanisms

      - Partial Connection Detection (Some pins connected, others open)
      - Intermittent Contact Filtering (Rapid connect/disconnect cycles)
      - Environmental Noise Immunity (EMI, vibration, temperature)
      - Cross-Pin Short Circuit Detection and Protection

#### 4 Connection Quality Scoring Algorithm

      - Contact Resistance Score (0-100 based on pin resistance)
      - Signal Integrity Score (Eye diagram analysis, jitter measurement)
      - Power Delivery Quality (Voltage regulation, ripple, noise)
      - Magnetic Alignment Score (Position accuracy within tolerance)
      - Overall Connection Health Index (Weighted composite score)
