# 4 Cloud Integration Architecture and Protocol Stack


#### 1 Hub Direct-to-Cloud Protocol Implementation (Wi-Fi/Ethernet - No host required)

      - Cloud Connection Establishment and Device Registration
        - Initial HTTPS Handshake and Certificate Exchange
        - Device Authentication via mTLS or API Keys
        - Cloud Service Discovery and Endpoint Configuration
      - Multi-Protocol Cloud Communication Stack
        - HTTPS REST API Layer (Device management, configuration)
        - WebSocket Secure (WSS) Real-Time Layer (Control events, state sync)
        - Server-Sent Events (SSE) Streaming Layer (Telemetry, notifications)
        - Protocol Multiplexing and Connection Management
      - Real-Time Grid State Cloud Synchronization
        - WebSocket-Based Event Streaming Protocol
        - State Delta Compression and Optimization
        - Conflict Resolution for Concurrent Updates
      - Cloud-Based Configuration and Management
        - RESTful Configuration API (JSON-based parameter management)
        - Real-Time Configuration Push via WebSocket
        - Configuration Versioning and Rollback Support

#### 2 Host Device-Independent Cloud Services

      - Cloud-Native Grid Management Interface (Web-based dashboard)
      - Remote Hub Configuration and Monitoring (HTTPS/WSS protocols)
      - Cloud-Based OTA Update Distribution (HTTPS file transfer with resume)
      - Multi-Hub Fleet Management (RESTful hub inventory and control APIs)
